# FlightTracker

[=> DEUTSCH](README_DE.md)

The Flight Tracker is made for educational purposes and is one of the first evolutional tools to track and combine a number of online services on one spot.

It is made to visualize the flight traffic of your local environment and to get information of the flying objects around you. Additionally, optional current weather maps are displayed.

## Configuration

The configuration file *config.ini* is used to modify your home location and appearance of your local neighborhood. By default, the Home location is set to the Berlin Brandenburger Tor.

### Location

Get your home location via [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps), click on your preferred location and check the URL of your browser window:

![google_maps_url](images/google_maps_url.png)

The location is coded in the format ```@<latitude>,<longitude>```. Fill these number in the latitude and longitude fields of your config.ini.

### Locale

If you prefer the maps come with a specific locale naming, e.g. German, set the ```localeLang = de``` and ```localeCountry = DE```, or find the proper locale definition of your preference (refer to the [ISO locale language code table](https://gist.github.com/eddieoz/63d839c8a20ef508cfa4fa9562632a21)).
